# Write code that prints all the odd numbers from 1 to 1000. Use the for loop and don't use an array to do this exercise.

# for num in range(1001):
#     print num
#
# mult = 5

# Create another program that prints all the multiples of 5 from 5 to 1,000,000.


# while (mult <= 1000000):
#     print mult
#     mult+=5


# Create a program that prints the sum of all the values in the list:
# a = [1, 2, 5, 10, 255, 3]
#
# runtot = 0
# for num in a:
#     runtot+=num
#
# print runtot


# Create a program that prints the average of the values in the list:
# a = [1, 2, 5, 10, 255, 3]
#
# runtot = 0
#
# for num in a:
#     runtot+=num
#     avg = runtot/len(a)
